Conway's Game of Life
=====================

This is a tool to play around with a visualisation of Conway's Game of Life. Conway's Game of Life (a.k.a. Game of Life) is a
cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.

The game plays out over a two-dimensional grid where cells can be in one of two possible states: dead or alive. Once started, the game plays itself out according to the
following rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
